# Chapter 10 - Update App Icon

## Overview
The application icon was updated to a new modern design to improve branding and user recognition.  
The new icon uses a **weather-inspired vector** with a transparent background and was exported in multiple resolutions.

---

## Implementation Steps

1. Generated the new icon using AI-based vector design.
2. Exported the asset as `.webp` files in multiple densities:
   - `mipmap-mdpi`
   - `mipmap-hdpi`
   - `mipmap-xhdpi`
   - `mipmap-xxhdpi`
   - `mipmap-xxxhdpi`
3. Updated `ic_launcher.xml` and `ic_launcher_round.xml` under `mipmap-anydpi-v26`.

---

## Changes in Git
The following files were replaced or added:
- `app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher.webp`
- `app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher_round.webp`
- `app/src/main/res/mipmap-*/ic_launcher_foreground.webp`
- `app/src/main/ic_launcher-playstore.png`

---

## Benefits
- More professional look for the app.
- Better visibility in the launcher and Play Store.
- Adaptive icon support (foreground + background layers).

---

## Next Steps
- Test the icon in both light and dark mode.
- Generate Play Store assets (feature graphic, banner, screenshots).
